DSS
===

**@version 1.0**

**Note:** Documented Style Sheets **(DSS)**. DSS is node module that exposes a CLI for KSS a style of commenting for your CSS that will generate a well formed HTML/CSS/JS file containing documentation about your styling.

Use `~$ dss build` to build the documentation while within the folder containing the KSS documented CSS files.

##Work in progress
*This repo is a work in progress, I'm hoping to have a proof of concept up in the next few weeks. The logic to create the documentation will be based on KSS but done in Node, not in Ruby. I'm also getting some inspiration from `grunt.js`'s work in terms of a nice CLI implementation.*
